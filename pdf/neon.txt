split_here Strength split_here 
split_here ++Upright++ Self-control, courage, compassion

This physical realm has nothing for me."split_here

I've been listening and it's like the lines all rhyme every time we hit the

disappointments that haunt your memory - you'll replace them with my
caged comforts and as you feel those past hurts on your heart less and

your way, we'll shine all the brighter."split_here

split_here The Moon split_here 
split_here ++Upright++ Illusion, anxiety, guidance, subconscious

beaten death itself! We thought our offspring would be grateful for all of
our scraps and abuse. But it was always going to come down to this - we

What's left of vegetation out there is getting quite scarce so I'd like to
suggest that for the next quarter we try to funnel some of the profit
margins towards the off-world colony proj... Oh pardon. I see I've been

your shoulder, the wires buzzing with disbelief, the city exhaling a breeze

don't know if we can make things better, but it's finally up to us to try."split_here

it's so mundane that everyone and anyone can have the same thing and

purposeful ignorance of."split_here

uncertainty

collective mental collapse."split_here

everyone learning their own way of performing it and each of us claiming
we know the best way forward into what is frankly an undefined space.
None of us knows but all of us think we do. If we could spend a moment
working with each other instead of trying to one-up each other, we could
get somewhere real. Instead, we are stuck in place squabbling like pigeons
fighting over the last piece of bread."split_here 
split_here --Inverted-- Repression, avoiding conflict, tension
split_here"We have magic now and we've formed a group to train and control it. And
where once our intelligence was amplified by each other, we now have the
collective idiocy running rampant. The worst of us took charge and we
stand here, helpless to stop It. They brings out the worst of our behavior
